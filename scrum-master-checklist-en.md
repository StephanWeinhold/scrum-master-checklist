* [] How are my team members?  
Really, how are they? Are they all in a good mood? Does anyone have problems, is anyone in need of my support? Not (only) as Scrum Master, but (as well) as a human being.
* [] How is my team?  
How do they grow as a group? Which [Tuckman phase] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development) are they experiencing? Are there any developments that I should prepare them for? Is there any potential for conflict that I have to pay attention to?
* [] How is my product owner?  
How are things going for him? Is he enjoying enough support from the team, the special department, and me?
* [] How is the special department?  
Am I overhearing the latest gossip? What topics and projects are currently in progress? When was the last time I was there and talked to the people?
* [] How is my organization doing?  
Am I too absorbed in daily business? After all, I should support the agile transformation of the organization. Am I doing that too?
* [] How am I?  
Dropped clue: _mental hygiene_. Do I have the support I need? Are there hidden conflicts? Are there things that I put in front of me?
* [] How is the Product Backlog?  
Is it clean and prioritized properly? Are enough stories estimated? Are there old stories lottering? Does it need to be thinned, updated and mucked out?
* [] How are the Scrum Board and the other information radiators?  
Are they accepted and used? If not, why not? Do I have to muck out again?
* [] How does the medium and long term forecast look like?  
Do I have a plan how teams and members develop? Is this plan still up to date? Is it adjusted? Do I have priorities and improvements for the time being?
